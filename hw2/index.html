                        the way company data is stored and analyzed. The company currently does not have a data
                        warehouse, which is impacting their ability to maintain accurate data and perform accurate
                        and detailed data analysis, and therefore needs a proposal for a data warehouse solution.
                        Proposal should include why selected data warehouse is the best solution, estimated costs for
                        warehouse, and estimated time to implement, and any other implications or concerns.</p>

                        health from consumer shopping perspective. The company wants to construct data warehouse

                        multiple data sources, especially from merchant shopping behavior, the hypothesis is that
